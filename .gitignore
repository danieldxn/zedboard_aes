# files, dump files that are created upon Vivado/SDK errors)

*.jou

# --- SDK specific ---

# exclude some obscure hidden SDK folders
/sdk/.metadata/
/sdk/webtalk/
/sdk/RemoteSystemsTempFiles/

# hw_platform : exclude the entire hw_platform folder, as
# we'll regenerate everything from the .hdf file
# make sure to include the bitstream in the .hdf file when exporting
# from Vivado!

# BSP : only keep .cproject, .project, .sdkproject, .system.mss
# and Makefile
# i.e. the ps7_cortexa9_0 lib files are regenerated automatically
/sdk/sd_bsp_0/ps7_cortexa9_0/

# Application : keep everything, except ignored file patterns
