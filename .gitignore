# --- SDK specific ---

# exclude some obscure hidden SDK folders
/SDK/.metadata/
/SDK/webtalk/
/SDK/RemoteSystemsTempFiles/

# hw_platform : exclude the entire hw_platform folder, as
# we'll regenerate everything from the .hdf file
# make sure to include the bitstream in the .hdf file when exporting
# from Vivado!
/SDK/design_1_wrapper_hw_platform_0/

# BSP : only keep .cproject, .project, .sdkproject, .system.mss
# and Makefile
# i.e. the ps7_cortexa9_0 lib files are regenerated automatically

# Application : keep everything, except ignored file patterns
